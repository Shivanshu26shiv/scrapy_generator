# The Rise and Fall of My One-Click Chrome Extension

## **Tired of Copy-Pasting Requests? So Was I.**

If you've ever worked with **web scraping**, you know the pain. Open DevTools, go to the **Network** tab, right-click, copy as cURL, paste it into some online **cURL to Python converter**, check headers, cookies, and payloads, then manually tweak it into a **Scrapy request**.

It's a process that screams _"automation needed!"_

So, like any good developer, I did what we all do when annoyed by repetitive tasksâ€”I built a **Chrome extension**.

## **One Click to Scrapy Glory**

My extension was simple:
- Open Network tab in any Chrome window which has your site openend
- It auto-grabbed the latest request, hence need to click on "Relay XHR"
- Go to Scrapy Generator tab
- It formatted them **exactly** like a Scrapy spider.

No more manual conversions. No more bouncing between tabs. Just one click, and I had everything in Scrapy's `Request()` format.

## **And Then... Chrome Decided to "Help"**

Just when I was about to put my extension on the Web Store, Chrome rolled out a little feature called **"Ask AI."**

Yeah. That **Ask AI**.

Turns out, Chrome's AI can do exactly what my extension didâ€”_but better_.

- It doesnâ€™t just extract headers and cookies; it **understands** them.
- It can **generate code in different languages** (not just Python).
- It even suggests **optimizations** (sometimes questionable, but still!).

In short, **Google pulled a Thanos**, snapped its fingers, and made my extension obsolete overnight.

## **Do I Regret It? Not Really.**

Building the extension taught me a lot:
- **How to intercept and extract requests in Chrome**.
- **How to structure Scrapy-friendly data**.
- **How quickly AI can make our work redundant.**

So while my extension wonâ€™t be changing the world anymore, at least it saved me from manually converting network requests for a while.

Maybe I'll pivot into something even betterâ€”like an AI-powered version that enhances the Ask AI results. _(Or maybe Iâ€™ll just go back to copying cURL like everyone else.)_

### **Lesson Learned:**
The best automation tool isnâ€™t the one you buildâ€”itâ€™s the one Google hasnâ€™t built yet.

### **Want to See the Extension Anyway?**
I might still drop the code on GitHub for fun. If youâ€™re interested, let me know!

_(Or just use Ask AI like everyone else. I wonâ€™t judge.)_ ðŸ˜…
